# Intro to Machine Learning Labs

## Lab 1: Intro to ML Packages: SKLearn
First, we'll walk through the [sentiment analysis tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab1/sentiment_analysis_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on SKLearn. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through the [news group excerise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab1/news_groups_exercise.ipynb), and [property prediction exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab1/property_prediction_exercise.ipynb) yourself.

Sample solutions for both exercises are available in the [lab1](https://github.com/yala/introML_chem/tree/master/lab1) folder.

## Lab 2: Intro to Deep Learning Packages: PyTorch
First, we'll walk through the [pytorch tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab2/pytorch_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on PyTorch. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through the [beer review excerise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab2/beer_review_exercise.ipynb), and [property prediction exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab2/property_prediction_exercise.ipynb) yourself.

Sample solutions for both exercises are available in the [lab2](https://github.com/yala/introML_chem/tree/master/lab2) folder.

## Lab 3: Intro to Advanced Architectures: CNNs and RNNs
First, we'll walk through the [mnist tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab3/mnist_tutorial.ipynb) and the [advanced sentiment analysis tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab3/rnn_and_cnn_tutorial.ipynb). Next, you'll apply what you learned on the property [advanced prediction exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab3/property_prediction_exercise.ipynb).

We'll provide a sample solution for both exercises right before the next class so you have a chance to experiment.

## Lab 4: Intro to MPNNs
In this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab4/message_passing_neural_network_tutorial.ipynb), we'll walk you through building a message passing neural network to do molecular property prediction.
