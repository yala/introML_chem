# Intro to Machine Learning Labs

## Lab 1: Intro to ML Packages: SKLearn
First, we'll walk through the [sentiment analysis tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab1/sentiment_analysis_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on SKLearn. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through the [news group excerise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab1/news_groups_exercise.ipynb), and [property prediction exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab1/property_prediction_exercise.ipynb) yourself.

Sample solutions for both exercises are available in the [lab1](https://github.com/yala/introML_chem/tree/master/lab1) folder.

## Lab 2: Intro to Deep Learning Packages: PyTorch
First, we'll walk through the [pytorch tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab2/pytorch_tutorial.ipynb) together, and cover how to build and tune models on PyTorch. Next, you'll apply what you learned, and work through the [beer review excerise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab2/beer_review_exercise.ipynb), and [property prediction exercise](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yala/introML_chem/blob/master/lab2/property_prediction_exercise.ipynb) yourself.

We'll provide a sample solution for both exercises right before the next class so you have a chance to experiment.



## Running the labs
The labs are Google Colaboratory notebooks, so just click the `View in Colaboratory` link on the notebook, and you should be all set!
To save your progress, you can copy the notebooks to your own google drive.
